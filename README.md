# Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data by connecting Python to a SQL Server database for querying, preprocessing the data, and finally visualizing insights using Power BI. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from sales records, such as sales trends, regional performance, top products, and customer behavior, to aid business decision-making.

## Workflow

1. **SQL Database Connection**:
    - Establish a connection between Python and SQL Server using `pyodbc` or `SQLAlchemy`.
    - Perform SQL queries to retrieve sales data for analysis.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing in Python**:
    - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect data formats.
    - **Feature Engineering**: Create new columns like total sales, profit margins, or category-wise sales.
    - **Data Aggregation**: Group data by regions, sales teams, products, etc.
    - **Data Transformation**: Normalize and scale features if needed for specific analysis.

3. **Data Visualization in Power BI**:
    - Load the cleaned and preprocessed data from Python into Power BI.
    - Create visualizations to show key insights:
        - **Sales Trends**: Line charts showing sales performance over time.
        - **Top Selling Products**: Bar charts of the most popular products.
        - **Regional Sales**: Heatmaps or geographic maps of sales performance across different regions.
        - **Customer Segmentation**: Pie charts or treemaps showing customer demographics or purchase behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes sales records from different regions, products, and customers. Key columns in the dataset might include:
- **OrderID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Product**: Name or ID of the product sold
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold
- **Price**: Price per unit of the product
- **TotalSales**: Total sales amount for each order (calculated as `Quantity * Price`)
- **Region**: Geographic region of the sale
- **SalesRep**: Sales representative handling the order
- **OrderDate**: Date when the order was placed
- **Customer**: Customer's information (e.g., Customer ID, Customer Name)

## Steps

### 1. SQL Server Connection and Querying

- Connect Python to SQL Server using `pyodbc` or `SQLAlchemy`:
    ```python
    import pyodbc

    conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};'
                          'SERVER=your_server;'
                          'DATABASE=your_database;'
                          'UID=your_username;'
                          'PWD=your_password;')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = "SELECT * FROM sales_table"
    sales_data = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
    ```
  
- Perform SQL queries to retrieve and filter sales data:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        Product, SUM(Quantity) as TotalQuantity, SUM(TotalSales) as TotalSales
    FROM 
        sales_table
    WHERE 
        OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
    GROUP BY 
        Product
    ORDER BY 
        TotalSales DESC;
    ```

### 2. Data Preprocessing in Python

- **Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
    ```

- **Handle missing values**:
    ```python
    df.fillna(0, inplace=True)
    ```

- **Create new features** (e.g., profit margin):
    ```python
    df['ProfitMargin'] = df['TotalSales'] - (df['CostPrice'] * df['Quantity'])
    ```

- **Group and aggregate data**:
    ```python
    regional_sales = df.groupby('Region')['TotalSales'].sum().reset_index()
    ```

### 3. Visualization in Power BI

- **Load preprocessed data into Power BI**:
    - Export the cleaned data from Python into a CSV or directly connect Power BI to the SQL Server for real-time updates.
    - Create visualizations such as:
        - **Sales trends** over time (line chart).
        - **Top-selling products** (bar chart).
        - **Regional sales performance** (geographic map).
        - **Customer behavior** (segmentation using pie or treemap).

## Requirements
